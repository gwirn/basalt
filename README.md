Create hotkeys to launch programs or scripts that perform a range of different task.

## Configuration
The config file in which the keymaps are defined will be searched in
```sh
$HOME/.config/basalt/key.map
```
In this file `#` are ignored and can be used as comments. The shortcuts need to be set as `KeyCode-KeyCode = [ command, argument ]`. Some example scripts and an example key.map can be found [here](https://github.com/gwirn/basalt/tree/master/examples). Malformatted lines will be ignored. The keycodes to use can be found [here](https://github.com/ostrosco/device_query/blob/b5ba13089c611b1deb3a6804e1f3032301d0fd5d/src/keymap.rs#L9).

## KeyMaps 
Be aware that on MacOS the `ALT` key is seen as `META` while on Linux it is registered as `LAlt` or `RAlt`.
